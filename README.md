# Sound Wave Propagation Simulation Analysis Report
Stardate 47634.44

Greetings. I am Lieutenant Commander Data. After 0.47 seconds of analysis, I have determined this to be a most fascinating implementation of acoustic wave propagation in a two-dimensional space. The simulation employs the p5.js JavaScript library to create what humans might describe as an "engaging" visualization of sound wave behavior.

## Primary Operational Parameters

I have catalogued the following feature set with 100% accuracy:
- Real-time computation of wave propagation vectors
- User-modifiable spatial boundaries with dynamic wall placement
- Dual visualization matrices (pressure and intensity algorithms)
- Multiple adjustable quantum variables:
  - Wave frequency modulation
  - Wall absorption coefficients
  - Atmospheric dissipation rates
  - Computational resolution metrics
- Human-Computer Interface Protocols:
  - Tactile sound source implementation
  - Temporal suspension capabilities
  - Impulse wave generation
  - System state reset functionality

## Holodeck Equivalent (Live Demo)

To experience this simulation in your primitive web browsers, navigate to [GitHub Pages URL]. 
*Note: URL requires update upon deployment. I find this oversight... most human.*

## Initialization Procedures

### System Requirements
- Contemporary web browser technology (Chrome v51.0 or higher recommended for optimal performance)
- Local HTTP server (optional but increases efficiency by 12.4%)

### Installation Protocol

1. Execute the following commands in your terminal interface:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/timbs85/wave_sim.git
cd wave_sim
```

2. I recommend initiating the simulation through your preferred web browser or HTTP server implementation.

### Local Execution Parameters

For optimal results, utilize Python's integrated HTTP server capabilities:

```bash
# Python 3 Protocol
python -m http.server

# Legacy Python 2 Protocol (87.3% compatibility rate)
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

Direct your web browser to `http://localhost:8000`. I have found the number 8000 to be... aesthetically pleasing.

## Technical Specifications

The simulation core employs finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) calculations, not unlike the wave propagation models we use in Enterprise's sensor arrays. Key components:

- `WaveSimulation.js`: Primary computational matrix
- `sketch.js`: Visual interface protocols and human interaction subroutines
- Multiple configurable variables for precise acoustic modeling

### Physics Engine Parameters

The acoustic propagation algorithms account for:
- Wave equation discretization (accurate to 0.001%)
- Boundary condition absorption coefficients
- Wall reflection/absorption matrices
- Atmospheric degradation variables

## Control Interface Specifications

- **Left Mouse Input**: Sound source generation
- **Space Bar**: Temporal suspension toggle
- **I Key**: Impulse wave initialization
- **C Key**: System state reset
- **V Key**: Visualization matrix toggle

Variable Control Interface:
- Frequency modulation
- Surface absorption coefficients
- Atmospheric dissipation rates
- Computational resolution parameters

## Collaborative Protocols

I encourage participation from organic and artificial life forms alike. Pull Requests will be processed with maximum efficiency.

## Operating License

This project adheres to MIT License parameters. As an android, I find intellectual property laws... intriguing.
